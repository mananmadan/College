##Things to do in root loci sallybus:
1. Root locus plots ( how to make and what are they ) ## done
2. Properties of root loci and applications ## mostly theory ( useless)
3. Stabiliy range from root loci ##To be done 
4. Determination of roots of closed loop system  ## done 
5. Transient response and stability from root locus. ##to be done
6. Effect of pole zero addition ## to be done
7. Desired closed loop pole location ## to be done

##To be done:
Baiscally stability analysis from the root locii part is left and transient response is also left.

Root locus techinuque is a graphical way of representing how might the root of system change , on chanching
a specific parameter in the system , for eg gain etc .

## why it is used for?
This technique is used as a stability criteria of a system in the field of classical control theory.

## what does it consist of?
It is basically consisiting of a complex s plane which contains the closed loop poles of the system.
The points that are part of the root locus, satisfy certain conditions.

##some basic truths:
T(S) = G(S)/ 1 + G(S)*H(S)

To find the roots of the system the characteristic equation will be G(S)*H(S) = -1

In system without delay:

G(S)*H(S) = K * (  (s+z1)(s+z2)(s+z3)... ) / ((s+p1)(s+p2)....)

z1,z2,z3 are the zeroes of the system 
and p1,p2,p3 are the poles of the sytem
