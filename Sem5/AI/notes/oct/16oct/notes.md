## Fuzzy Logic Control

### Assumptions
- The plant is observable and Controlable 
- Further assumptions
  - ![ass1](ass1.jpg)

### Design steps
- some in the picture above
- some are in the picture below
- ![ds2](ds2.jpg)


1. Measurement i/p are taken as variables that represent relevant condition of controller process
2. Fuzzificaton
3. Fuzzification measurements are then used by inference engine to evaluate the control rules stored in the fuzzy rule base.
4. Defuzzification

### General Scheme for Fuzzy Logic Controller
- ![scheme](scheme.jpg)

### Washing Machine Problem
- We have i/p variables and o/p variables

- DEFINE IN LINGUISTIC FORM
- Dirt :{Small Dirt , Medium Dirt , Large Dirt}
- Grease :{SG,MG,LG}

- Output variables
   - Wash Time
   - {Very Short , Medium , Large , Very Large}
