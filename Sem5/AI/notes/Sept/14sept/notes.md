## Composition
- If X is related to y
- if y is related to z
- then x is also related to z

## Prob

- find relation b/w a and c using max min composition

## Max-min composition

- Here the resultant matrix will be A* C of order  3*3
- One element will be R1a * C1b
- Another element in the row will be R1a * C2b
