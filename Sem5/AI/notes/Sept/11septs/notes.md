## Relations
- Uptill Now we have talked about crisp relations
- Relations are not always 0 or 1
- But in real life the relations can be between (0 and 1)
 - This the relations are not always crisp , it can be fuzzy also

## Example

## Fuzzy Relations
- They are represented in the form of matrices

### Operations on Fuzzy Relations

- If a fuzzy set has a value of 1 , then it is called identity set
