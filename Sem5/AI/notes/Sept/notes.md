- What are crisp set and fuzzy sets?
- Eg. on fuzzy sets
- Operations on crisp sets
  - Intersection
  - Union
  - Compliment
- Operations on fuzzy sets
  - Intersection -> (Min(a,b))
  - Compliment -> (1-a)
  - Union -> (Max(a,b))
- Properties of sets
  - Associativity  = A U (B U C) = (A U B) U C
  - Commutavity ==> A U B = B U A
  - Distributivity ==> A U (B U C) = (A U B) U (A U C) 
  - Idempotency ==> A U A = A
- Membership Function
  - Defination
  - Shape of the membership function
- Representation of Fuzzy Sets

- Crisp Relations
- Cartesian Product Method to obtain all the relations
- Fuzzy Relations
  - Since Fuzzy Relations are represented as fuzzy sets , we can apply fuzzy operations on it
- Operations on Relations 
 - Intersection
 - Union
 - Compliment
 - Containment
 - Sum
 - Scalar Product
