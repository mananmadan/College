## Abstaction

- Sets can be fuzzy and crisp
- There can be operations on these sets
- Fuzzification is conversion of fuzzy to crisp
- Deffuzification is conversion of crisp to fuzzy
- Relations can be defined b/w these sets ie relations b/w fuzzy and crisp sets
- Relations form matrices , and some operations can be applied on that as well
- Fuzzy Number is a special case of a convex , normalize fuzzy set
- There can be operation on fuzzy number
- Then theirs is classical logic
   - Implications are a part of classical logic
   - Tautologies are proposition , which are also part of classical logic
   - tautologies and deduction
- Then we moved on fuzzy logic
   - Approximate Reasoning
   - Fuzzy Rule Base System
   - Aggregation of fuzzy rules
   - Inferences
   - Graphical Techniques on Inferences

- Fuzzy Logic Control
   - i/p --> fuzzification --> implication --> agrregation --> deffuzzication --> ans
   - The whole process is called inference
