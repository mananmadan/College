# Facts to know!

- 40 pins are available in 8086
- 20 bit adress but hence 1MB Memory Acess
- 16 bit data bus
- Has 2 operating Modes
  - Min : Only 8086
  - Max : Other MPC'S such as 8088/8089 also collabrate to get better performance
- 8086 has 16-bit IO adresses , hence it can acess 64k IO ports at once
- Flags in 8086
    - ![flag-register](flag-register.jpg)
    - Overflow Flag
    - Carry Flag
    - Zero Flag
    - Parity Flag
    - Auxiliary Carry Flag
    - Direction Flag
    - Interrupt Flag
    - Sign Flag
- JMP
    - It has 2 main branches:
    - Near Branch
     - Inter Segement Only IP has to be changed
    - Far Branch
     - Intra Segment Both CS and IP has to be changed
- CALS
   - It transfer the program control to a subroutine to another program with the intention of coming back
   - 8086 first saves the address of the next instruction into the stack before branching to the sub-routine
   - It also has two branches:
     - Near Branch
      - Program execution has changed to a subroutine inside the segement
      - Intersegement
     - Far Branch
      - Intra Segement

- Diff b/w JMP and CALL
 - ![diff](diff.jpg)

- Diff b/w 8086 and 8088
 - ![diff_mpc](diff_mpc.jpg)
 - Mainly data bus is 8 bits in 8088
 - hence you can transfer 1 byte per cycle hence it is slower
 - queue size is of 4 bytes in 8088 , where as it is 6 bytes in 8086
# Concepts

Pipeling
--------
- 8086 supports pipelining
- It is the Process of fetching next instruction while processing current instruction
- This makes the processing faster as the next instruction is already fetched , during the current instruction processing.
- When the current instruction finishes we can just process the fetched instruction

Architechtural Units
--------------------
- 8086's architecture is made up of 2 units:
  - Bus Interface Unit
  - Execution Unit

- **Bus Interface Unit**
 - Interface of 8086 to other devices
 - Performs read / write , interfacing with IO's
 - Main Components of BIU:
    - Segement Register
    - Adress Generation Circuit
        - Generates a 20 bit physical adress using segement and offset adress
        - Physical Adress = Segement Adress * 10h + Offset Adress

- **Execution Unit**
 - It fetches instruction from BIU , decodes and executes them
 - Basically the "brain" of the 8086 sytem
 - Main Components of Execution Unit:
    - General Purpose Registers
    - AX , BX , CX , DX
    - Special Purpose Registers
    - Stack Pointer , Base Pointer , Source Index , Destination Index
    - ALU (**16bit**)
    - Flag Register

Memory Segementation
--------------------
- Deviding the memory into logically different parts called segements
- Max Size of a segement is 64kb and minimum size if 16bit
- "The main reason to do segementation is to devide the memory logically , so that the process involving those memory can be isolated"
- Memory is segemented into:
    - Code Segement
      - Used to hold the program to be executed
      - Base Adress : CS Register
      - Offset : IP Regiser
    - Data Segment
      - Used to hold general data
      - Base Adress : DS Register
      - Offset : BX register
    - Stack Segment
      - Holds the stack memory which operated in LIFO manner.
      - Base Adress : SS Register
      - SP holds the offset adress of the Top of the stack
      - BP holds the 16-bit offset adress during Random Acess
    - Extra Segement
      - Used to hold general data
      - Base Adress : ES Register
      - Offset : DI register

- Advantage of Segmentation
    - Devides the memory logically
    - Acess 1MB using 16-bit address
- Disadvantage
    - Overall Memory is 16 * 64kb , but at a time 4*64kb can be acessed

Memory Banking
--------------
- Concept of deviding the odd adresses and even adresses of Memory into different banks to increase the processing rate
- ![banking](banking.jpg)
- Advantages
 - This banking scheme allows to access two aligned memory locations from both banks simultaneously and process 16 bit data transfer.Memory banking doesnâ€™t make it compulsory to transfer 16 bits, it facilitates the 16 bit data transfer.
