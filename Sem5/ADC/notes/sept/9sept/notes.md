## Complex form of Equations

## We expand using Fourier
- ![expand](expand.jpg)

- FM is non linear
- So it's banwidth is different to represent

## How does FM Wave looks?
- ![fm_wave](fm_wave.jpg)
- BW ==> is tough to calculate

## To represent Frequency 
- We break the signal into peices using niquist sampling freq

### Sampling Theorem
