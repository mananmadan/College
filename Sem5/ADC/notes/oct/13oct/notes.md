## Instantaneous Sampling 
- We can multiply to 1/H(f) to remove the distortion

## Natural Sampling
- It is easier to convert to digts
- Hence it is better for digital communication

## Different types of Pulse Modulation
- In PAM all of the Infomation is gettig embedded on magnitude axis
 - PAM (Flat top sampling)
- In all of the below Information is getting embedded in time axis
 - PWM (Pulse Width Modulatio)
 - PPM
 - PDM
 - PTM 

## Generation and Demodulation
- Study ourselves

## Analog to digital converter
- Paramters Revise
  - Quantatization
  - Resoltion
  - Precision
  - Accuracy
  - Settling Time
