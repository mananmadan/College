# Mind Map 

* First , you have to model the sytem using the State Space Variables to gain insight!
* Then you have to use these state space variable to obtain the canonical forms!
  * Canonical Forms are basically simple version of the state matrices
  * We use these canonical forms to gain insights in the system
  * Like if the system is controllable or observable
  * Or if the sytem is stable or not


## How does the lesson plan scale to the Mind Map

### Modelling using State Space
- What is the state space representation?
- State space for MIMO systems
- Conversion of transfer functions to the state space representations

### Canonical Forms
- The state variables are transformable
- Conversion of the transfer function to the canonical state variables
 - First Companioin Form
 - Second Companion Form
 - Jordan Canonical Form

### Controlability and Observability
- Once we have obtained the canonical form
- Check the controlability matrix [ A AB A^2B ...]
  - Find out the rank of this controlability matrix and see if this is == n
- Now , we can analyse that to say if the system is controllable and observable


### TO DO
- State Equation from transfer function and vice versa
- Canonical Forms
- Solutions to state space models
- State Transition Matrix
