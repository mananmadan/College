## Liapunous Stability Criteria
- ![lp_stb](lp_stb.jpg)

- Here also we will be only considering the equiblirium state (ip = 0)
- Here we will non be linearizing but analysing NL system as it is

## Stability of the system
- Stability is Judged in terms of energy

## SMD
- ![svmodel_spd](svmodel_spd.jpg)
- To check stability we have to check rate of change of energy of the system
- ![diff_smd](diff_smd.jpg)
- The rate of change of energy is negative
- Thus it's traj will be
