# Mind Map 

## Intro to SS
- First,you have to model the sytem using the State Space Variables to gain insight!

   - For this we studied conversion from TF to SS
   - Coversion of SS to TF
   - Invariance of Tranformation to SS


## Canonical Forms and Controllability and Observability

- Since the SS is invariant to transformation , so we will be able to obtain some forms of matrix that are helpful in analysis

- Then you have to use these state space variable to obtain the canonical forms!

  - Canonical Forms are basically simple version of the state matrices
  -  We use these canonical forms to gain insights in the system
  -  Like if the system is controllable or observable
  -  Or if the sytem is stable or not


## Pole Placement
- Once I know that my system is completely controllable then I can manipulate it to get the desired output --> Pole Placement

  - Pole Placement is the process of find the correct controls for the problem
  - So that I can place my poles wherever I want to and get the desired outputs
