### Sinusoidal Input Response

- Slides in the slides folder

- Given the linear transfer function of the system
- We will give the input as the sine wave 
- Then we will take the laplace inverse of the output of the system
- It will have an exponential term , a cos term , a sin term
- Exponential term will decay over time
- But the sin and the cos term , will be merged to find a single term
- This term will have a phase shift and the magnitude will be reduced
