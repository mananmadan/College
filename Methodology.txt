##Curent Topics:

Maths :: Partial Differential Equations
?? Vector calculas

Control System :: Root locus is to be done
Most probably class is going forward on that


T and Measurement :: RTD and Thermistor and Thermocouples.
RTD is done by class and Thermistor is done by class
Next topic is Thermocouples --> not done by class
RTD,Thermistor is not done by me

Industrial Electronics :: uptill now one lecture is given to be completed
not done by me

DCS :: Assgihnment on Digital Logic Families.
So what is happening in DCS is that mam have done most of the numerical part earlier
and is now doing the theory part.
Here what I have to do is Flip - Flop and Digital Logic Families.

##How will I write the notes::

1. Can highlight in the book using xournal
2. Write by hand vs write on the computer in google docs --> mainly benifit is add pictures 
and links.

I think google docs + xournal should work.


##Tommorow
Finish T and M tommorow
Most probably only that class is happening only.
Then finish digital logic desighn families.
and should do some control also.
