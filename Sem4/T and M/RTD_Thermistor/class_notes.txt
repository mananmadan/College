## 150 in bentley and 282 in nakra
## PTC and NTC(Semiconducting material)
PTC: positive temp co-efficient , NTC : negative temp co-efficient

PTC used in fuse etc. and NTC finds in measurement
NTC is more usefull to ICE
Eq 8.2 and Eq 8.3 describes the behaviour of NTC thermistor 

the variation is exponential for RTD which makes the device more non-linear.
all the shapes on bentley pg 151.
comparision between thermistor and RTD given on page 283
comparision between them is also based on sensitivity.
nakra has shown that thermistors are 10 times more sensitve to RTD.
see that derivation
##there beta is material constant and normall around 3000-4000k
##other one is R_Not which is also material constant
Also since the device is non linear it will required means and methods for its linearization
To in the equation is value at room temp or any other ref
R0 is resistance at temprature T0
on page 255 of pdf see 9.3 question
in fact both 9.3 and 9.4 both
##to be done in homework
also thermistor may be put with op-amp to make question 
but the basic idea is change of R with Temp.
As long as we understand this and the governing equation rest is all math and circuit.
This completes our thermistor , homework to be done 
Next will be thermocouple .
Next on thursday 12-1PM.
regular class time.
