1:07 AM
So far only 44, does it form the attendance

1:09 AM
we shall refer Bentley make it ready

1:12 AM
Refer section 8.3

1:12 AM
Inductive sensing elements

1:14 AM
You would have studied equivalence between electrical and magnetic circuits, this section start similar

1:15 AM
go through till eqs 8.30

1:16 AM
Self-inductance of a coil can me computed from reluctance

1:17 AM
Based on this Variable reluctance elements are designed and used for various measurement

1:19 AM
A small variation in air gap causes a measurable change in inductance so that we have the basis of an inductive displacement sensor.

1:20 AM
Refer Fig. 8.11, various configurations

1:21 AM
Differential or push/pull reluctance displacement sensor is of importance

1:23 AM
go through all the derivation and understand

1:27 AM
any query?

1:29 AM
Can you derive the results of Differential reluctance displacement sensor

1:29 AM
why"

1:30 AM
any particular issue

1:30 AM
Arya?

1:31 AM
Yes very much

1:31 AM
Read the book line by line, it is simple

1:33 AM
Fine, read the para after eq. 8.37

1:33 AM
Even this you should be able to implement

1:34 AM
basically incorporate the sensor into the bridge and derive the final voltage o/p which is bound to be linear

1:35 AM
Next is LVDT

1:36 AM
Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) displacement sensor

1:36 AM
Section 8.3.2

1:37 AM
Basically it is a three coils transformer

1:37 AM
This sensor is a transformer with a single primary winding and two identical secondary windings wound on a tubular ferromagnetic former (Figure 8.12).

1:38 AM
two secondaries are connected in series opposition

1:39 AM
Figure 8.12 shows LVDT and connections to phase-sensitive detector.

1:40 AM
Input is x as can be observed in this fig, x being a displacement

1:41 AM
Observe the connections of two secondaries

1:41 AM
two secondaries are connected in series opposition

1:42 AM
when the armature is symmetrical to both the secondaries (x=0) the output shall be zero

1:42 AM
is that right

1:43 AM
input x is applied to the core/armature

1:43 AM
this is a passive sensor

1:44 AM
I have also given a NPTEL link for this yesturday

1:45 AM
Also have a look on Fig. 8.13 wherein the different waveforms are given for the voltages

1:46 AM
remember the out of phase responses for two secondaries

1:48 AM
See Figure 8.14 A.C. and D.C. characteristics of LVDT.

1:51 AM
Following is the assignment

1:51 AM
1)
A1:52 AM
To be submitted by this Friday

1:53 AM
Hope is is clear

1:53 AM
Shall we close

1:53 AM
Bye
