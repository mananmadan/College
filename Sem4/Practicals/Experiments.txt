1. Torque speed characteristics and determine the transfer function of a dc motor
long would take time!..
2. study the 1st order electrical system by --> obtaining step response 
                                            --> obtaining frequency response of a typical first order system 
short , revise 1st order system ..
3.performance characteristics of angular position error detector using 2 potentiometer

* Basically, we have to find things like linearity in this system ...
Here what we have to do is vary the angles of the potentiometer then measure the voltage , difference obtained and thus we can check the linearity and get to as how much is the error in leniarity of the device.

* We can do this same thing using also ac exiitation and after that using a de-modulator and hence find out the error in that too.

4. study perfmance of various types od controller used to control temprature of an oven 
(have to revise steady state error , and stability parameters of a controller)
(basically trying out best controller for the identification of a particular plant)



5. For each of the second order systems below , find e,wn,Ts,Tp,Tr,%over-shoot and plot the step response using matlab
revise second order system ....

6. Determine the closed-loop step response using MATLAB
see if taught close loop .... step respose

7. Plotting Niquist Plot 
revise and study niquist plot ...

8. Plotting root locus and bode plots.
revise and study root locus and bode plots ...

Basic Theory Rivision:
 First Order System:
1.  C(s) =  1
    ----  -----
    R(s)  1 + sT

now according to the input we can put the value of R(s)
> R(s) = 1/s for unit step input
> R(s) = 1/s^2 for unit ramp input
2. To calculate in terms of time we can but s=jw and calculate the amplitude 
and then put w = 2*pi*T to calculate the values.


 Second Order System:
1. C(s)     wn^2
  ------ = ----------------------------
   R(s)    s^2 + 2*(zeta)*wn*s + wn^2

where zeta is the damping factor
and wn is the undamped natural frequency

Things based on Order of the system:
1. Steady state error ==> (C(t) - R(t)), where t--> infiniy 
2. Delay time ==> time required to reach 50% of the final value
3. Rise time ==> to reach from 10 to 90 of the overdamped system
             ===> time to reach from 0 to 100 percent of the final value in under damped system
4. Peak time ==> time required to reach the peak of the second order system 
5. Peak Overshoot ==> the normalized difference between the peak and the steady state value
 c(tp) - c(infinity)
 ------------------- * 100
  c(infinity)
6. Settling time = time required to stay in tolerance band(maybe 2% or 5%)
