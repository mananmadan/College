##What are choppers??

They are DC-DC convertors , also known as buck convertors,
they are different from transformers as transformers have only fixed value of coil
rotations due to which they are restricted after construction in the amount of the 
voltage that can step down .

##So
Step down choppers --> buck converters 
Step up choppers --> boost convertors.

Two quadrant are basically class b and class c choppers.
class e chopper will be foind

Voltage and current commuted chopper --> Learn and Grow youtube vedios.
Jones and Morgan chopper

2 numericals on chopper to do.
